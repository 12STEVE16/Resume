    <p>Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. As a baby,
       his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in
       a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of
       Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent.
        Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His
         parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime.
         To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting
         crime. Clark Kent resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist
         for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane,
         photographer Jimmy Olsen, and archenemy Lex Luthor.
